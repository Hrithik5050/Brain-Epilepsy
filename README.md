# Brain Epilepsy - Seizure Detection using Machine Learning and Deep Learning

## Project Overview
This project focuses on detecting multiple types of epilepsy seizures using Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques. The primary challenge is acquiring data from the TUSZ dataset and converting EDF files into CSV format for further processing.

## Data Processing Steps
1. **Data Collection** - Acquiring EEG seizure data from the TUSZ dataset (Version 2.0.3).
2. **EDF File Conversion** - Using EDF Browser and MATLAB to convert EDF files into CSV format.
3. **Feature Extraction & Engineering** - Extracting relevant features from EEG signals to improve model performance.

## Key Features
- **Machine Learning & Deep Learning Models**: Implementing models to classify different seizure types.
- **Preprocessing Techniques**: Handling raw EEG data efficiently for training.
- **Automated Feature Extraction**: Enhancing model accuracy using statistical and frequency-based features.

## Future Enhancements
- Improve the feature selection process to enhance classification accuracy.
- Experiment with deep learning architectures for better performance.
- Integrate real-time seizure detection for practical medical applications.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- MATLAB
- EDF Browser
- Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch
